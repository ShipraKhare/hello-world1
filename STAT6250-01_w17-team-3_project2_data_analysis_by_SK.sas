This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding Bart Ridership in bay area.

Dataset Name:<jan_mar_EMBR> , <barf_interlv> & <barf_interlv_wrkplace_sort> 
created in external file STAT6250-01_w17-team-3_project2_data_preparation.sas,
which is assumed to be in the same directory as this file

See included file for dataset properties

title1 
"Research Question:How significantly does the ridership changes in Embercadero station on new year's eve as compare to any normal day?"
;

title2
"Rationale:This should help rideshare companies to plan surge and availability of rides and plan targeted advertizing campaigns for special events in SFO financial district."
;

footnote1 bcolor=antiquewhite bold underlin=1
" Average ridership during event hours for Embercadero station on normal day Vs New year's evening."
;

footnote2 bcolor=antiquewhite bold 
"Ridership has a very significant rise as compared to any normal day during special events at SFO ."
;

footnote3 bcolor=antiquewhite bold 
"Since Embercadero is the last bart station in SFO , the ridership rises 9 times more during special events in SFO e;g new year's eve."
;

Methodology: When combining jan1 and mar31 datasets in data preperation file we
created a new dataset for the Embarcardero station for hourly data for 0,1 and
2 hours (1200 hrs,1300 hrs,1400 hrs) for the dates jan 1st and march 31st.Here 
we use proc mean to calculate mean by DATE and then use proc print to print the 
mean data for 1st of Jan as Compared to March 31st for the hours 0,1 and 2.
;

/*calculating average ridership by date for Embercardero station*/ 
proc means data = jan_mar_EMBR mean noprint;  
    by date;
	output out = jan_mar_EMBR_out (DROP = _TYPE_ _FREQ_ HOUR);
run; 

/*Printing averages for both dates*/

title1
" Research Question: Does the ridership significantely differs for San Francisco stations as compared to the stations in Hayward and Fremont area for a given month?"
;

title2
"Rationale:It would help us understand and plan for proper resources,infrastructure, advertisements and fedral funding allocation for major BART Stations."
;

footnote1 bcolor=antiquewhite bold underlin=1
" Stations in the SFO area shows very high avarage rideship as compare to stations in Fremont. "
;

footnote2 bcolor=antiquewhite bold underlin=1
" Very high amount of people uses bart for comute to SFO and back as compare to any other area. "
;

*
Methodology: We picked up 2 clusters of stations on SF and Hayward area from
the barf_interlv dataset. Namely SF stations were EM, MT, PL and CC whereas 
Fremont stations are HY, SH, UC and FM. Using proc means to calculate the mean
ridership date for these 2 clusters shows a 10 times more usage in SF area as 
compared to the Hayward/Fremont BART stations.

" Research Question:Which station has the highest bart ridership for the reason of workplace and what are the top two destinations of their work?"

" Rationale: This will help BART streamline job related advertisements on specific station. This data can also be shared with other job sites and job related services."

" South Hayward is the station with highest ridership for people who use bart for Workplace. "

*
Methodology: Using the interleaved data "barf_interlv" of "barf" and "HO" 
from the data preperation file we have sorted the data by workplace variable
and then used the proc print to print the top BART station with maximum #
of riders traveling for work.And then sorting the data to get the top station
where the people are going for work.
