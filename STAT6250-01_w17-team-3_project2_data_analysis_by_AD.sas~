This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding ridership data on the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, BART.
Dataset Name: barf, ho, barf_interlv, arrv created in external file
STAT6250-01_w17-team-3_project2_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file.
See included file for dataset properties

vehicles available in household Vs number of riderships in a station ?";

title2 "Rationale:This would help us to find if number of vehicle available in 
household change the number of riderships from particular station. 
In future if new stations needs to be opened up the demographic information 
can be used to evaluate the location.";

Methodology: 1. Find the sum of each station
             2.Using proc sql append the total as column
             3.Using the value from percentage of vehicle available at home 
             Vs this column do the regression analysis
